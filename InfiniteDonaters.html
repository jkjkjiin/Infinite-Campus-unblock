                Why You Should Donate
                <br>
                <br>
                There Are A Few Reasons That Donating Would Help.
                <br>
                1. Running The Live Discord Chat Server
                <br>
                The Live Discord Chat Requires A Server To Run, And Servers Cost Quite A Bit
                <br>
                To Maintain, Donating Would Let Me Upgrade The Server, And Pay For The Program That Runs It
                <br>
                <br>
                2. The Domain Cost
                <br>
                The Infinitecampus.xyz Domain Costs Around 30$ Per Year.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. To Support The Devs
                <br>
                Currently, There Are Only 2 People That Have Contributed To The Website, Me, (The Main Dev) And My Friend.
                <br>
                It Is Hard To Upkeep, Bug Test, Code, And Fix Problems. The Community Here Has Been Very Supportive
                <br>
                Of Everything We Have Done, However, We Are Somewhat Swamped With Fixes, And Stuff We Want To Add.
